          <p>Website development for an archive of information about Chinese typography.</p>

            <em>
              The Chinese Type Archive (BETA) compiles and catalogs resources related to Chinese typography to make them open and accessible to the widest possible audience of designers. Its aim is to support designers who use Chinese typography by:
              <ol>
                <li>Developing descriptors for concepts, typefaces, and related entities</li>
                <li>Archiving related and relevant visual examples</li>
                <li>Providing points of entry through translation and highlighting relationships that may be equivalent and not equivalent to other typographic systems</li>

          <p>A system of posters for a lecture series at Parsons. These posters were designed to work both independently, as 8.5 &times; 11" sheets of paper, and as a group. Different modes of production distiguish different layers of information: laser printing, risography, and a custom-made sticker, which functions as an indicator of the next upcoming lecture.</p>

          <p>Website design and development for the Imaginative Mobilities seminar, a year-long investigation into rethinking borders between design and social sciences.</p>
          <p><em>The Imaginative Mobilities seminar will shift the discussion away from the frame of open or closed borders, to re-imagine the meaning and design of borders. Starting with the concepts of mobility and immobility across political spaces, we will attend to different kinds of movement and to the way movement and space are co-constructed.</em></p>

          <span class='project-name'><em>JavaScript, A Context & Workshop</em></span>
          <p>JavaScript is a programming language, not just a tool. Programming is much more complex and nuanced; it is a distinct discipline – like science, design, or engineering – with history and conventions. Placing it within a historical and cultural context yields deeper understanding.</p>
          <p>This workshop, given twice at Parsons School of Design, sought to explain JavaScript in a larger scope. <em>JavaScript, A Context</em> was the lecture given during the first half of the workshop. <em>JavaScript, A Workshop</em>, the second half, was a demo that explained some of the main programmatic tasks that designers face when making websites.</p>

          <p>An eBook I worked on during my time at <a href='https://canopycanopycanopy.com'>Triple Canopy</a>. This is the first publication created programmatically with their open-source authoring platform, <a href='https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber'>b-ber</a>. They have since <a href='https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/working-on-our-thoughts'>written more about the platform</a> and thought process.</p>
          <p><em>In ‘International Art English,’ Alix Rule and David Levine describe the language of contemporary art by analyzing a corpus of press releases sent by e-flux, which is paid to do so by museums, biennials, publishers, and art fairs in order to reach a subscriber base of more than ninety thousand art professionals. The essay appeared in 2012 and soon surpassed the popularity of every other Triple Canopy publication.</em></p>
