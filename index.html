          <span class='project_name'><em>JavaScript, A Context & Workshop</em></span>
          <p>JavaScript is a programming language, not just a tool. Programming is much more complex and nuanced; it is a distinct discipline – like science, design, or engineering – with history and conventions. Placing it within a historical and cultural context yields deeper understanding.</p>
          <p>This workshop, given twice at Parsons School of Design, sought to explain JavaScript in a larger scope. <em>JavaScript, A Context</em> was the lecture given during the first half of the workshop. <em>JavaScript, A Workshop</em>, the second half, was a demo that explained some of the main programmatic tasks that designers face when making websites.</p>

          <p>An eBook produced during my time at <a href='https://canopycanopycanopy.com'>Triple Canopy</a>. This is the first publication created programmatically with Triple Canopy’s forthcoming open-source authoring platform, <a href='https://github.com/triplecanopy/'>bber</a>.</p>
          <p>In their own words: <em>“In ‘International Art English,’ Alix Rule and David Levine describe the language of contemporary art by analyzing a corpus of press releases sent by e-flux, which is paid to do so by museums, biennials, publishers, and art fairs in order to reach a subscriber base of more than ninety thousand art professionals. The essay appeared in 2012 and soon surpassed the popularity of every other Triple Canopy publication.”</em></p>

          <p>Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby, working at Parsons School of Design, have co-created and helped lead a year-long investigation into rethinking borders between design and social sciences.</p>
          <p>In their own words: <em>“The Imaginative Mobilities seminar will shift the discussion away from the frame of open or closed borders, to re-imagine the meaning and design of borders. Starting with the concepts of mobility and immobility across political spaces, we will attend to different kinds of movement and to the way movement and space are co-constructed.”</em></p>

          <span class='project_name'><em>Single-Serve Sites</em></span>
          <p>randomguitarchords.com is a website that generates random, yet entirely playable, chords for the guitar. This is a useful tool that uses computation to help overcome creative blocks and stimulate new ideas.</p>
          <p>theselinksarebroken.com is a growing collection of “page not found”, “error 404”, “oops” pages and similar. The site is a reflection of the temporality of online space. The antithesis of clickbait, any of these addresses will lead you to a dead-end, a rare circumstance on a constantly expanding network. Visitors can submit links. An absence of style emphasizes the hyperlink archetype. The site was featured in episode 86 of the <a href='https://soundcloud.com/goodpoint/86-purpose'>Good Point</a> podcast.</p>
          <p>only1px.com asks visitors to consider the pixel – the building block of digital environments.</p>
          <p>elvisonthebeach.com is an autoplaying slideshow of beachside Elvis photos. This site was created in collaboration with Sam Schwall.</p>
