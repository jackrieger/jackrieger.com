          <span class='project_name'><em>Modes of Practice</em></span>
          <p>A system of posters for a lecture series at Parsons. These posters were designed to work both independently, as 8.5 &times; 11 sheets of paper, and as a group. Different modes of production distiguish different layers of information: laser printing, risography, and a custom-made sticker, which functions as an indicator of the next upcoming lecture.</p>
          <p>Designed in collaboration with <a href="http://math-practice.org/">E Roon Kang</a> and <a href="https://brendangriffiths.com/">Brendan Griffiths</a>.</p>

          <p>A digital publication about art, design and technology. The publication’s identity is based on its seasonally changing homepage, which reflects upon computational aesthetics. The publication contains both written content and software, usually browser extensions or small applications. The website also features a custom side-scrolling format for text articles.</p>

          <span class='project_name'><em>Imaginative Mobilities</em></span>
          <p>Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby, working at Parsons School of Design, have co-created and helped lead a year-long investigation into rethinking borders between design and social sciences.</p>
          <p>In their own words: <em>“The Imaginative Mobilities seminar will shift the discussion away from the frame of open or closed borders, to re-imagine the meaning and design of borders. Starting with the concepts of mobility and immobility across political spaces, we will attend to different kinds of movement and to the way movement and space are co-constructed.”</em></p>

          <span class='project_name'><em>JavaScript, A Context & Workshop</em></span>
          <p>JavaScript is a programming language, not just a tool. Programming is much more complex and nuanced; it is a distinct discipline – like science, design, or engineering – with history and conventions. Placing it within a historical and cultural context yields deeper understanding.</p>
          <p>This workshop, given twice at Parsons School of Design, sought to explain JavaScript in a larger scope. <em>JavaScript, A Context</em> was the lecture given during the first half of the workshop. <em>JavaScript, A Workshop</em>, the second half, was a demo that explained some of the main programmatic tasks that designers face when making websites.</p>

          <p>An eBook produced during my time at <a href='https://canopycanopycanopy.com'>Triple Canopy</a>. This is the first publication created programmatically with Triple Canopy’s forthcoming open-source authoring platform, <a href='https://github.com/triplecanopy/'>bber</a>.</p>
          <p>In their own words: <em>“In ‘International Art English,’ Alix Rule and David Levine describe the language of contemporary art by analyzing a corpus of press releases sent by e-flux, which is paid to do so by museums, biennials, publishers, and art fairs in order to reach a subscriber base of more than ninety thousand art professionals. The essay appeared in 2012 and soon surpassed the popularity of every other Triple Canopy publication.”</em></p>

          <p>A catalog with data and interviews about a particular street. When a business owner wants to start a new venture, how are they supposed to know whether the location they select is conducive to their business?</p>
          <p>Street Catalog aims to provide this information about various streets, so that people have a better idea of whether or not it is a good idea to invest in certain locations.</p>
