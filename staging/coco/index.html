      <span class='project_title'>Procell Archive Catalogue</span>
      <p>The Procell Archive Catalogue is a curated collection of 100 vintage items from some of the most influential designers of the last 60 years. With a focus on the ‘80s, ‘90s and early 2000s, these pieces have left a notable, powerful mark on culture.</p>
      <p>Heavily influenced by Vitsœ (specifically, Vitsœ’s 1973 Catalogue) and Braun’s design legacies, the archive book is constructed from a rigid grid and type system that embodies the design elements of the German movement. Notebook binding, 168 pages.</p>
