      <h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>JavaScript is the programming language of the web.</p>

<p>HTML and CSS are the structure and visual appearance of a website. JavaScript offers the ability to turn these static web pages into dynamic, interactive experiences. As you proceed through your work as a designer, understanding JavaScript and programming in general is beneficial to bringing your design concepts to fruition on digital platforms.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>JavaScript was developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. During this time, the internet was still in its infancy, and most web pages were static and lacking in interactive features. Netscape recognized these limitations and tasked Eich with creating a language that would complement HTML and CSS.</p>

<figure>
  
    <img src="netscape.png" />
  
  
    <figcaption>This was the era of Netscape.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Although the language was created under time constraints – it took Eich merely ten days to develop the initial prototype – JavaScript had an immediate impact.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-hypercard">But first, Hypercard</h2>

<p>Before diving deeper into JavaScript, it’s worthwhile to acknowledge the influence of HyperCard, a software tool developed by Apple in 1987. HyperCard introduced many people to programming through its graphical interface and “stacks” of cards, which could contain text, images, and interactive buttons. In many ways, HyperCard served as an early model for the web, offering a user-friendly platform where people could create software applications without extensive coding knowledge.</p>

<figure>
  
    <img src="hypercard.png" />
  
  
    <figcaption>This was the era of Hypercard.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>HyperTalk was the scripting language for HyperCard. Although it was designed in a very different context, its intent—like JavaScript’s—is to enable interactivity and functionality. To illustrate their similarities and differences, let’s consider a simple example, a clickable button that updates a piece of text when clicked:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>on mouseUp
  put <span class="s2">"Clicked!"</span> into field <span class="s2">"Output"</span>
end mouseUp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Later on, you’ll see just how similar this is to JavaScript. Back to the 90s.</p>

<h2 id="the-browser-wars">The Browser Wars</h2>

<p>Netscape Navigator and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer were the key players in the web browser market in the late ’90s. This period saw intense competition between the two companies, commonly referred to as the “Browser Wars.” Each company was keen on incorporating unique features to lure users, and JavaScript became a critical part of this competitive landscape.</p>

<p>While the Browser Wars accelerated the development of new features, they also led to a fragmented web landscape where different browsers had varying levels of support for JavaScript features. This inconsistency made it challenging for developers and designers alike to create web experiences that were universally accessible.</p>

<h2 id="standardization-ecmascript">Standardization: ECMAScript</h2>

<p>The discrepancies in JavaScript’s implementation led to the necessity for standardization. ECMAScript, first published in 1997, served this purpose by providing a set of standardized guidelines for JavaScript. This initiative by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) aimed to ensure that the language’s core functionalities remained consistent across different browsers and platforms.</p>

<figure>
  
    <img src="ecma.png" />
  
  
    <figcaption>This is the current specification document. You will likely never interact with this.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Subsequent versions of ECMAScript have introduced new features, like asynchronous programming and arrow functions, that make the language more powerful and easier to use. These updates continue to expand the possibilities for what can be achieved in both design and development.</p>

<h2 id="contemporary-javascript">Contemporary JavaScript</h2>

<p>Fast-forward to the present, and JavaScript has become an omnipresent force in web development. It is not limited to just client-side scripting; server-side environments like Node.js have extended its utility to back-end development. Libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js (which power Facebook, Airbnb, Adobe, just to name a few) further simplify complex tasks, enabling the creation of more sophisticated web applications.</p>

<h2 id="front-end-vs-back-end">Front-end vs. Back-end</h2>

<p>In discourse around JavaScript you will likely have heard the terms “front-end” vs “back-end”. Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with in their browser. This is where JavaScript originally made its mark, offering the tools to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.</p>

<p>Back-end development deals with the server-side operations that power a website, from databases to application logic. JavaScript’s utility has expanded to this realm as well, but for a long time it could not function in this capacity. We will be exploring JavaScript in a front-end context.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="hooking-up-javascript">Hooking up JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript can be included in an HTML document in a few different ways. The most common (and the only way I suggest you to use) is to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, which can be placed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> of your document. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag can either contain JavaScript code directly, or reference an external JavaScript file. The latter is the preferred method, as it keeps your HTML and JavaScript separate, making your code easier to maintain and debug.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello, world!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

  <span class="c">&lt;!-- site content --&gt;</span>

  <span class="c">&lt;!-- JavaScript goes right before end of body tag --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"script.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="consolelog">console.log()</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log()</code> method is a useful tool for debugging your JavaScript code. It prints a message to the browser’s console, which can be accessed by right-clicking on a web page and selecting “Inspect” (or “Inspect Element” in Firefox). The console is a great way to test your code and see if it’s working as expected:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Hello, World!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<figure>
  
    <img src="console.png" />
  
  
</figure>

<h2 id="variables-and-values">Variables and Values</h2>

<p>Variables in JavaScript are placeholders for storing data. They can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and even other functions. JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, unlike languages like C++ and Java.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Double slashes are used for comments in JavaScript</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">myName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Jack</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="c1">// string, a bit of text</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">27</span><span class="p">;</span>           <span class="c1">// number</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">isTeacher</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>   <span class="c1">// boolean, true or false</span>

<span class="c1">// array</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">hobbies</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">cooking</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">tennis</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">gaming</span><span class="dl">"</span>
<span class="p">];</span>

<span class="c1">// object</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">anotherPerson</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Bob</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">age</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">45</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">likesToCook</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One equals sign is used for variable assignment. You can think of it as “is” or “gets”. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var myName = "Jack"</code> can be read as “the variable myName gets the value Jack” or “the value Jack is stored in the variable myName”.</p>

<p>Arrays and objects are higher-level data types that can store multiple values. Arrays are ordered lists of values, while objects are collections of key-value pairs (the key is on the left, and the value is on the right). You can access specific values in an array or object by using bracket notation or dot notation, respectively:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// access the first item in the hobbies array</span>
<span class="nx">hobbies</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// would give you "cooking"</span>

<span class="c1">// access the age property of the anotherPerson object</span>
<span class="nx">anotherPerson</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">age</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// would give you 45 as a number, not a string</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way you declare a variable can also affect your code. While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> was traditionally used for variable declarations, it has largely been replaced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting">scope and hoisting</a> issues. The difference between them is a little out of scope for this class, and I don’t care which one you use.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> keyword is used for variables that can be reassigned, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> is used for variables that should not be changed after their initial assignment. For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> you don’t have to think about this.</p>

<h2 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h2>

<p>Conditionals in JavaScript are essential for decision-making and controlling the flow of your program. The simplest form of a conditional is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement, which will execute a block of code if a given condition is true.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">18</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">age</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">18</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">You can vote in the next election!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can extend this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else if</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> statements to manage more complex conditions. Conditionals are fundamental for things like form validation, feature toggles, or implementing game logic, but you can also use them in many creative ways.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mood</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">happy</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mood</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">happy</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">😀</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mood</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">sad</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">😢</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">😐</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s up with the triple equals? In JavaScript, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code> operator checks for equality of value, but not necessarily type. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 == "1"</code> would evaluate to true, even though the left item is a Number while the right is a String. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">===</code> operator checks for both value and type, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 === "1"</code> would evaluate to false. It’s generally good practice to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">===</code> to avoid unexpected behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>

<p>Loops are repetitive execution of code. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop is the most common type of loop, useful for iterating through arrays, strings, or executing a block of code a specific number of times. They’re foundational elements for algorithms and essential tools for tasks like data manipulation and transformation.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">fruits</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">apple</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">banana</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">cherry</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">for </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">fruits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fruits</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s a lot going on inside the parentheses:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let i = 0;</code></p>

<p>Initialize - A variable i is set up and initialized with 0. You could also use var</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i &lt; fruits.length;</code></p>

<p>Condition - The loop will continue as long as i is less
than the length of the fruits array.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i++</code></p>

<p>Increment - i is increased by 1 after each iteration,
which is what allows the loop to eventually end.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">++</code> is a special operator that increments a value by 1.</p>

<p>The semi-colons separate the three parts of the loop.</p>

<p>So, this would output to the console:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>apple
banana
cherry
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s do something else with this same data:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">fruits</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">apple</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">banana</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">cherry</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">for </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">fruits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">fruits</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fruits</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">reverse</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fruits</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// Output will be ["elppa", "ananab", "yrrehc"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, we’re using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">split()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">join()</code> methods to reverse each string in the array. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">split()</code> splits a string into an array of substrings, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse()</code> reverses the order of the elements in an array, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">join()</code> joins all elements of an array into a string:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">apple</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// ["a", "p", "p", "l", "e"]</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are built-in functions (also called methods) that are part of the JavaScript language. So within the loop, we are accessing each item in the array, splitting it into an array of characters, reversing the order of the characters, and then joining them back together into a string. This is a common pattern in JavaScript, chaining multiple methods together to achieve a desired result.</p>

<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>

<p>Functions serve as the building blocks of JavaScript code, encapsulating specific tasks or computations. Functions can take input through parameters, perform actions or calculations, and then return an output. This modular approach makes your code easier to manage, debug, and understand. It also promotes code reusability, as functions can be called multiple times throughout your code with different arguments. JavaScript functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and even returned by other functions.</p>

<p>Functions can be used for all kinds of things. Think of them as reusable tools that you can use to build your program. For example, you could write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the string reversed (as we did above):</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nf">reverseString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">reverse</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nf">reverseString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">hello</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>   <span class="c1">// "olleh"</span>
<span class="nf">reverseString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">goodbye</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// "eybdoog"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With a function like this, you can easily reverse any string by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverseString()</code> with a string as an argument instead of having to write the same code over and over again.</p>

<p>What’s inside the parentheses is called a <em>parameter</em>. Parameters are variables that are used to store the data that is passed into a function. In this case, in the initial function definition the parameter is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code>, which is a string. You could name that whatever you want, but it’s often useful to name it something generic that implies the type of data that the parameter expects you to give it.</p>

<p>When you call the function, you pass in an <em>argument</em>, which is the actual value that is passed into the function.</p>

<p>So now our reverse fruits example could be:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nf">reverseString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>This is something you’ll have to learn through experience. You cannot substitute one type of brace for another.</p>

<h2 id="document-object-model-dom-manipulation">Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation</h2>

<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document in a web browser. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically update content, structure, and styling. This is the basis for creating interactive web applications. By using methods like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">querySelector</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">classList</code>, you can select specific elements and manipulate their attributes, content, or styles.</p>

<p>Changing the DOM is often as straightforward as selecting an element and altering one of its properties. However, for more complex changes, you might employ loops and conditionals to traverse and manipulate the DOM structure. Libraries like jQuery initially simplified these tasks, but native JavaScript methods have since evolved to become quite powerful on their own. Do not use jQuery.</p>

<h2 id="and-much-more-">And much more …</h2>

<p>JavaScript isn’t just for making websites functional; it’s also used for creative coding. Libraries like <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> make it easier to create art, graphics, animations, and interactive content. These libraries provide an accessible introduction to complex topics like computer graphics, physics simulations, and even machine learning, all within the browser environment. We’ll get into this in later weeks.</p>

<p>JavaScript can also be employed in game development, music production, and interactive storytelling. The language’s flexibility and the wide range of available libraries mean that your creative possibilities are very high.</p>
