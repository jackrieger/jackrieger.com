      <h1>Session 7</h1>
      <h2 id="office-hours---group-session">Office Hours - Group Session</h2>

<p>A few of you have asked about office hours. I am thinking of planning a group session for the weekend, on Sunday. If you are interested, see me after class and we can find a time that works for all of us.</p>

<h2 id="reading-discussion-activity">Reading discussion activity</h2>

<p>We watched this lecture, as our reading for this week:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/U_PGr5d9r7Q?si=obed38qjVAS7Mx0g">Muriel Cooper | David Reinfurt | Talks at Google</a> – David Reinfurt</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let’s skip around the video and talk about the work shown. What do we see?</li>
  <li>What’s one thing you learned?</li>
  <li>What’s one thing you’re curious about?</li>
  <li>In your opinion, what are the biggest similarities and differences between print and digital design?</li>
</ul>

<p>Share these thoughts here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qh69L_0kZR0UhI0nUy3y29JznWSJC5G-7gUXooXNJd4/edit?usp=sharing">document</a></p>

<h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>

<p>We’re going to talk about how flex and grid layouts work in CSS:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="break">Break</h2>

<h2 id="activity-recreating-art-with-css">Activity: recreating art with CSS</h2>

<p>From beginning to end, we are going to make webpage recreations of the following two artworks:</p>

<figure>
  
    <img src="homage_apparition.jpg" />
  
  
    <figcaption>Homage to the Square: Apparition, Josef Albers</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<figure>
  
    <img src="mondrian.jpg" />
  
  
    <figcaption>Composition with Red Blue and Yellow, Piet Mondrian</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<h2 id="site-browsing">Site browsing</h2>

<p>If we have time today, let’s browse some of your favorite sites and talk about their design.</p>

<h2 id="for-next-class">For next class</h2>

<p>Next class we have the midterm edit. You will sign up for a 1-on-1 time with me in this classroom on this sheet:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLbFxS_tnEOFYUDVjxBtnE9Z6_la0TN1xyeP7K4tngk/edit?usp=sharing">Sign-up here</a></p>

<p>Outside of your meeting time, you do not need to come to class.</p>

<h3 id="midterm-edit">Midterm Edit</h3>

<p>For Midterms, we will have a one on one meeting. At that time, you will present a refined iteration of your current collection. Prior to this meeting, think about the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is your theme? Has it evolved from the initial description?</li>
  <li>How is the content communicating the theme? What about the design?</li>
  <li>How would you describe the pacing of the collection so far? Does it feel considered? Can there be a moment for a dramatic break, or an acceleration?</li>
  <li>Are there opportunities to establish a template or system to the design — if so, when, where, and how? Can we break the system mindfully to add interest?</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also prepare a short written doc (one paragraph) that explains your collection’s theme so far and explains three other avenues you can explore for the remaining weeks of the semester.</p>
