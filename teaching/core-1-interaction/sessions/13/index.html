      <h1>Session 13</h1>
      <h2 id="-fix-your-homepages-">ðŸš§ Fix your homepages ðŸš§</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="/teaching/core-1-interaction/students">students page</a> to make sure that your homepage is linked correctly. If itâ€™s not, fix it! This means that you do not have your homepage <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> in the root of your repository. You need to move it there. Donâ€™t have it in a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homepage</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">home</code> or anything else.</p>

<p>If I check:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://your-user-name.github.io/harmonic-collection/</code></p>

<p>and I donâ€™t see your homepage, itâ€™s wrong.</p>

<p><em>Why should we care about this?</em></p>

<p>When you make a website, the URL needs to be nice and neat. It helps people find your work and shows that you pay attention to detail.</p>

<h2 id="final-revision-requirements">Final revision requirements</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s go over what the final will entail, in two weeks.</p>

<p>From the project description:</p>

<h3 id="minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The website and all the entries must be responsive (work on a variety of screen sizes).</li>
  <li>While each entry will be unique, there should be unifying visual components between them</li>
  <li>All hyperlinks must be functional</li>
  <li>You will make use of a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to communicate a story</li>
</ul>

<p>On the day of the final you will have 10 minutes to present your site and receive feedback. You will present your theme, and show how you explored it in different ways through your three best entries. You will also show the homepage. Hereâ€™s a template for how the talk can go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show the homepage, talk about your theme idea / background</li>
  <li>Show an entry, talk about how it relates to the theme</li>
  <li>Show another entry, talk about how it differs from the first entry but still fits the theme</li>
  <li>Show a third entry, same as above</li>
</ul>

<p>I would recommend running through this a few times, and making sure that your presentation is about 4â€“6 minutes long, so we can have time for feedback.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to grade you on presentation skills. It should be fun, and you should be proud of your work! Iâ€™m going to grade you on the content of your site, and how well you communicated your theme.</p>

<h2 id="reading-discussion">Reading discussion</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s take 15 minutes to write a response to the reading for today:</p>

<h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>

<p>Weâ€™re going to jump forward a bit, in order to show you more of whatâ€™s possible. This topic is a little advanced, but itâ€™s important for expanding your understanding of what JavaScript can do.</p>

<h2 id="coding-from-life">Coding from Life</h2>

<p>Weâ€™re going to get p5 running and then draw a still life with it. This activity was created by <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/pages/coding-from-life.html">Laurel Schwulst</a>.</p>

<p>Get p5 up and running: <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">https://p5js.org/get-started/</a></p>

<p>Weâ€™re going to walk through the documentation as an exercise in itself, then start drawing.</p>

<h2 id="for-next-class">For next class</h2>

<p>This will be your final entry, Entry 11 (10 if youâ€™re not counting the homepage). For this entry, I want there to be more JavaScript than there is HTML. You can create HTML with JavaScript, which would not count towards the HTML total.</p>
