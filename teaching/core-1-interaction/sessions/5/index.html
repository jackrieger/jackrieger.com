  <div>
    
<ul>
  <li>D-DAP
    <ul>
      <li>D-DAP is a student-run club for designers interested in areas like web design, UX and creative coding: <a href="https://ddap.xyz" target="_blank">ddap.xyz</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CD Tutoring
    <ul>
      <li>There is 1 on 1 tutoring available for CD students, however they’re currently on strike just like the part-time faculty were a year ago. Keep watching announcements for when the strike may end, this is a great resource.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Readings
    <ul>
      <li>There was some miscommunication within the program about how readings are to be structured. We will have one reading per unit (4 weeks of class). More info TK.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Midterm Edit - October 17th
    <ul>
      <li>We will have a one on one meeting. At that time, you will present a refined iteration
of your current collection. Prior to this meeting, you’ll chat with your fellow classmates about the
following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>What is your theme? Has it evolved from the initial description?</li>
          <li>How is the content communicating the theme? What about the design?</li>
          <li>How would you describe the pacing of the collection so far? Does it feel considered?</li>
          <li>Can there be a moment for a dramatic break, or an acceleration?</li>
          <li>Are there opportunities to establish a template or system to the design — if so, when, where, and how? Can we break the system mindfully to add interest?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You will also prepare a short written doc (one paragraph) that explains your collection’s theme so far and explains three other avenues you can explore for the remaining weeks of the semester.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Late Work Policy (from the program directors &amp; syllabus):
    <blockquote>
      <p>Work that is submitted past the assignment due date, with no communication with faculty prior to the deadline, will result in automatic failure for the assignment. For work presented in a final or midterm critique, absence at critique will result in automatic failure for the assignment.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Emails
    <ul>
      <li>I want to help all of you and see you thrive, however I will likely not have time the day before class to answer in-depth questions. I will mainly be able to answer emails on the weekends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Office Hours
    <ul>
      <li>Please email me if you would like to meet up for office hours. If there are enough interested students, we may also have a group session.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="presentations--entry-2--3">Presentations – Entry 2 &amp; 3</h2>

<p>Prepare entries 2 and 3 to present on the projector. Everyone will have 6 minutes to present &amp; receive critique.</p>

<p>Your peers will lead the critique, <a href="/teaching/core-1-interaction/tools/randomizer" target="_blank">randomly selected</a>. Say one thing you like, or one question you have. I won’t speak until after you do!</p>

<h2 id="break">Break</h2>

<h2 id="lecture-box-model">Lecture: Box Model</h2>

<p>You’ve likely started working with padding, margins, and sizing things in CSS. Let’s talk more in-depth about how it works.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/teaching/core-1-interaction/lectures/box-model/">Box Model</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-next-class">For next class</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create Entry 4. With this week’s entry, think about how you might use some of the layering/collaging/positioning techniques we talked about with the box model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your entire harmonic-collection folder as-is thus far, as a zip file. It will have entries 1, 2, 3, and 4 in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please check all entry file names and make sure they are in the following format linked here:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/teaching/core-1-interaction/files/harmonic-collection.zip">harmonic-collection.zip</a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: you may or may not have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> folders depending on your entry. Some of you have subfolders within your entry folders – this is fine as long as the parent folder is named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entry-#</code></em></p>

<p><em>I will deduct points in the midterm review (in a few weeks) if your files and folders are named incorrectly. We are doing this now so I can give you feedback on it.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Email me a link to the Figma sketches you made for your homepage last week. I thought we would be able to get to these in class but I will have to review them on my own.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Notice</em></p>

<p>Next class we will be going to a lecture that starts at 10:30. Show up to class first, and will leave this building together a little after 10:00.</p>
