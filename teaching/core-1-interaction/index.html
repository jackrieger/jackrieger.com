      <h1>Core 1: Interaction</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This class is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative medium–as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms.</p>

<p>You can think of this class as a hands-on workshop where our browser is a canvas. We’ll experiment with code, develop formal design principles, and think about how our work fits into the broader context of the internet at large.</p>

# Unit 1

## Week 1-4: Working Methods and Web Typography

The first segment of Core Interaction will focus on the tools and concepts required for building interactive experiences. We’ll use the languages of the web because they’re accessible and immediately open up new modes of communication for designers, but the concepts will be transferable to any screen-based or interactive media.

In weeks 1-4 we will focus on:

- File management (naming, organization, file paths)
- Setting up and starting a new project
- Tools (code editor, inspector, git/github)
- HTML/CSS basic concepts and syntax
- Figma (components, prototyping, grids, canvas sizing)
- Putting a website online (hosting, Github, custom domains)
- Connecting to other web services

Unit 2: Week 5-8: Digital Canvas
In our second segment, we’ll investigate how designing for the digital canvas differs from other media. We will aim to understand the inherent complexities and how to use them to create compelling digital experiences.

In weeks 5-8 we will focus on:
Typography with HTML/CSS
CSS selectors (cascades, combining, parent/child, pseudo)
HTML structure (box model, dissecting a web page)
Layouting (position, float, flexbox, grid)
Designing for the digital canvas (how big is a browser?)
Asset creation (video, image optimization, webGL)

Unit 3: Week 9-11: Designing for Interaction
Thinking about a website as a series of linked pages, we’ll take the concepts we used to make individual web pages and apply them to larger systems. We’ll explore how our systems can be designed to flex, rather than break, under a wide range of variables while still maintaining the original intent of the design.

In weeks 9-11 we will focus on:
Multi-page systems
Programming basic user interactions (:hover, basic JS click, etc.)
Time-based design (interactive states, storyboarding, prototyping)
User models (entering and receiving data, user flows, UX patterns, ways of navigating)
Accessibility
Metadata (search, social)

Unit 4: Week 12-15: Networks
Because a website lives in a larger network of apps, websites, devices, and contexts, our final segment will explore how our website lives online. We’ll take the work we’ve done this semester and explore self-publishing and making our work public by putting our work on the internet.

In weeks 12-15 we will focus on:
Putting a website online (hosting, Github, custom domains)
Accessibility
Asset creation (video, image optimization, webGL)
Metadata (search, social)
Connecting to other web services
